# clue/soap-react [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clue/php-soap-react.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clue/php-soap-react)

A simple, async [SOAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) web service client library, built on top of [React PHP](http://reactphp.org/).

Most notably, SOAP is often used for invoking
[Remote procedure calls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) (RPCs)
in distributed systems.
Internally, SOAP messages are encoded as XML and usually sent via HTTP POST requests.
For the most part, SOAP (originally *Simple Object Access protocol*) is a protocol of the past,
and in fact anything but *simple*.
It is still in use by many (often *legacy*) systems.

This project provides a *simple* API for invoking *async* RPCs to remote web services.

* **Async execution of functions** -
  Send any number of functions (RPCs) to the remote web service in parallel and
  process their responses as soon as results come in.
  The Promise-based design provides a *sane* interface to working with out of bound responses.
* **Async processing of the WSDL** -
  The WSDL (web service description language) file will be downloaded and processed
  in the background.
* **Event-driven core** -
  Internally, everything uses event handlers to react to incoming events, such as an incoming RPC result.
* **Lightweight, SOLID design** -
  Provides a thin abstraction that is [*just good enough*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_good_enough)
  and does not get in your way.
  Built on top of tested components instead of re-inventing the wheel.
* **Good test coverage** -
  Comes with an automated tests suite and is regularly tested against actual web services in the wild

> Note: This project is in beta stage! Feel free to report any issues you encounter.

## Quickstart example

Once [installed](#install), you can use the following code to query an example
web service via SOAP:

```php
$loop = React\EventLoop\Factory::create();
$factory = new Factory($loop);
$wsdl = 'http://example.com/demo.wsdl';

$factory->createClient($wsdl)->then(function (Client $client) {
    $api = new Proxy($client);

    $api->getBank(array('blz' => '12070000'))->then(function ($result) {
        var_dump('Result', $result);
    });
});

$loop->run();
```

See also the [examples](examples).

## Usage

### Factory

The `Factory` class is responsible for fetching the WSDL file once and constructing
the [`Client`](#client) instance.
It also registers everything with the main [`EventLoop`](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop#usage).

```php
$loop = React\EventLoop\Factory::create();
$factory = new Factory($loop);
```

If you need custom DNS or proxy settings, you can explicitly pass a
custom [`Browser`](https://github.com/clue/php-buzz-react#browser) instance:

```php
$browser = new Clue\React\Buzz\Browser($loop);
$factory = new Factory($loop, $browser);
```

#### createClient()

The `createClient($wsdl)` method can be used to download the WSDL at the
given URL into memory and create a new [`Client`](#client).

```php
$factory->createClient($url)->then(
    function (Client $client) {
        // client ready
    },
    function (Exception $e) {
        // an error occured while trying to download the WSDL
    }
);
```

#### createClientFromWsdl($wsdlContents)

Same as createClient(), but leaves you the responsibility to load the WSDL file. This allows you to use local WSDL files, for instance.

### Client

The `Client` class is responsible for communication with the remote SOAP
WebService server.

If you want to call RPC functions, see below for the [`Proxy`](#proxy) class.

Note: It's recommended (and easier) to wrap the `Client` in a [`Proxy`](#proxy) instance.
All public methods of the `Client` are considered *advanced usage*.

#### soapCall()

The `soapCall($method, $arguments)` method can be used to queue the given
function to be sent via SOAP and wait for a response from the remote web service.

Note: This is considered *advanced usage*, you may want to look into using the [`Proxy`](#proxy) instead.

#### getFunctions()

The `getFunctions()` method returns an array of functions defined in the WSDL.
It returns the equivalent of PHP's [`SoapClient::__getFunctions()`](http://php.net/manual/en/soapclient.getfunctions.php).

#### getTypes()

The `getTypes()` method returns an array of types defined in the WSDL.
It returns the equivalent of PHP's [`SoapClient::__getTypes()`](http://php.net/manual/en/soapclient.gettypes.php).

#### withTarget($newTarget)

This method allows you to change the destination of your SOAP calls. It does not change the Client object, but returns a new
Client with the overriden target.

#### getWsdlTarget()

This method allows you to retrieve the target URL specified in the WSDL file.

#### returningRawResponses()

Returns a new Client instance that returns raw responses instead of responses parsed by the SoapClient class.
You can use this when you want to retrieve the cookies, or other headers of the response, or just parse the
response yourself.

### Proxy

The `Proxy` class wraps an existing [`Client`](#client) instance in order to ease calling
SOAP functions.

```php
$proxy = new Proxy($client);
```

#### Functions

Each and every method call to the `Proxy` class will be sent via SOAP.

```php
$proxy->myMethod($myArg1, $myArg2)->then(function ($response) {
    // result received
});
```

Please refer to your WSDL or its accompanying documentation for details
on which functions and arguments are supported.

#### Processing

Issuing SOAP functions is async (non-blocking), so you can actually send multiple RPC requests in parallel.
The web service will respond to each request with a return value. The order is not guaranteed.
Sending requests uses a [Promise](https://github.com/reactphp/promise)-based interface that makes it easy to react to when a request is *fulfilled*
(i.e. either successfully resolved or rejected with an error):

```php
$proxy->demo()->then(
    function ($response) {
        // response received for demo function
    },
    function (Exception $e) {
        // an error occured while executing the request
    }
});
```
